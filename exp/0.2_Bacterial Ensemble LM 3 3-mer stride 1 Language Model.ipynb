    "# Bacterial Ensemble Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains a language model on the ensemble of bacterial genomes assembled in the [Bacterial Ensemble 0 Data Processing](https://github.com/kheyer/Genomic-ULMFiT/blob/master/Bacteria/Bacterial%20Ensemble/Bacterial%20Ensemble%200%20Data%20Processing.ipynb) notebook. The language model trained is based on the AWD-LSTM architecture. the genomic input information is split into 5-mers with a stride of 2 bases between each 5-mer. The model is trained to take an input sequence of 5-mers and predict the next 5-mer. This allows us to train a model that learns the structure of genomic information in a totally unsupervised way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base of the language model (token embedding + LSTM layers) will then be used to initialize a classification model.\n",
